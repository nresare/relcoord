# relcoord version service

Small HTTP service for registering image versions and resolving the latest known version per image.

## Development

Run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Start the service locally:

```bash
uv run relcoord
```

By default the service uses in-memory storage. You can also select it explicitly:

```toml
[persistence]
backend = "in-memory"
```

See `relcoord.toml.example` for a remote SurrealDB backend configured with
idmouse-issued database tokens:

```toml
[persistence]
backend = "surrealdb"
uri = "ws://localhost:8000/"
namespace = "default"
database = "relcoord"

[persistence.idmouse]
url = "http://localhost:9000/token"
token-path = "/tmp/idmouse-bearer-token"
```
